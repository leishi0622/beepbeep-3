								<h2>Features</h2>

<a name="easy"></a>
<h3>Easy to use</h3>

<p>The principles behind BeepBeep are very simple: you can
<a href="quickintro.html">learn to write queries in five minutes</a>.
In your Java program, running queries and getting realtime results requires
<a href="quickintro.html#results">as little as five lines of code</a>, using
<a href="quickintro.html#jdbc">JDBC</a> if you want. No
heavy setup is required.</p>

<a name="language"></a>
<h3>Simple language</h3>

<p>BeepBeep's input language is called ESQL. Its intuitive syntax makes it
easy to write common queries in just a few keywords that
a non-specialist can read and understand.</p>

<p>Contrarily to the majority of
other CEP tools, <strong>what is common with SQL is written like in SQL</strong>. Many other
CEP engines reinvent a new syntax for simple tasks that SQL can already do.
For example, selecting all events where <code>cnt &gt; 10</code> in trace
<code>webfeeds</code> is written in Cayuga as:</p>

<pre class="code">
SELECT * FROM FILTER{cnt &gt; 10}(webfeeds)
</pre>

<p>while in BeepBeep you write, as you should:</p>

<pre class="code">
(SELECT * FROM webfeeds) WHERE cnt &gt; 10
</pre>

<p>Therefore, there are
large parts of it (SELECT, WHERE, etc.) that you already know&hellip; without
knowing it. We claim BeepBeep has the language with the closest syntax to
SQL.</p>

<a name="features"></a>
<h3>Extendable</h3>

<p>In Complex Event Processing, there is no "one size fits all", and no one
cannot foresee all the possible uses of a tool. Instead of cramming functions
into a language that remains frozen, BeepBeep was designed from the start to be
extended by users. Creating your own processors, which you can combine like
any other, takes <a href="custom.html">less than five lines of boilerplate
code</a>, and can be learned in minutes. This is easier than for any other
CEP engine.</p>

<p>Most importantly, you can also <a href="extend.html">define your own ESQL
syntactical rules</a> for the processors you create (again in less than 10 lines
of code), complete with arguments of
any type,
so that your processors can be used within ESQL expressions. This very flexible
mechanism is unique to all CEP engines, and makes it possible to create extension
packages that provide your own <strong>domain-specific language 
(DSL)</strong>.</p>

<a name="lightweight"></a>
<h3>Lightweight</h3>

<p>BeepBeep's JAR is <strong>under 300 kb</strong> and requires a vanilla JRE 1.6 (or later) to
run (compare this to <a href="http://www.espertech.com/">Esper</a>'s 5
<em>megabytes</em> of code and dependencies). It does not depend on any
other library, meaning you can fit it into places where others can't.</p>

<a name="push-pull"></a>
<h3>Push and pull modes</h3>

<p>All CEP engines are designed with a specific use case in mind: sources of events
produce events, which are passed to the query as they are generated. Whenever
the query generates a new output event, some callback function is called, and
your program can do something with this event. This is called <em>push</em>
mode.</p>

<p>There also exist the reverse functionality: whenever it requires so,
the program asks the query for a new event, and effectively <em>pulls</em> it
out; this, ultimately, may require pulling one or more new events from the source.
This is what you use when invoking a relational database with JDBC,
and iterate over the
lines of a result. No one would think of the reverse (being called back when the
database sends you a new line) as convenient. Yet, as far as we know, only BeepBeep
allows you to handle event traces in both push <strong>and</strong> pull mode,
depending on your needs.</p>

<a name="throughput"></a>
<h3>Good throughput</h3>

<p>Discussions on CEP are dominated by throughput: churning the most events per
second. If this is all that matters in your context, don't bother using <em>any</em>
of the CEP tools around, as you can write custom, low-level code that will
outpace them by a large margin. Any other choice means you're willing to
sacrifice some of that throughput for other factors: perhaps readability,
ease of use, built-in features, etc. (See: <a href="why.html">why use 
ESQL</a>.)</p>

<p>Still, it's good to know that BeepBeep fares well on that respect. Doing
benchmarks is always tricky (this is probably why all other tools claim
"high throughput" without giving any direct comparison with others), but on the
ones we did, BeepBeep stands somehwere between Esper and Siddhi for simple
queries (sliding windows, etc.). For more complex patterns, BeepBeep loses them
both, and in some cases is the only one able to complete a query without crashing
or timing out.</p>

<a name="versatile"></a>
<h3>Versatile</h3>

<p>Although you can extend the language to suit your needs, BeepBeep already
comes with a few extension packages to do things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Generate realtime heatmaps, histograms and scatterplots with the Gnuplot package</li>
<li>Read and write data to common formats (e.g. CSV, XML)</li>
<li>Call any external command on an event and fetch its standard output</li>
<li>Read event sources across a newtork by simply giving their URL</li>
<li>Write complex sequential patterns of events using Linear Temporal Logic</li>
<li>Read a table from a relational database and turn it into an event trace on the fly</li>
</ul>
