/**
 * Finds a peak in a data stream using the
 * <a href="http://www.originlab.com/doc/Origin-Help/PA-Algorithm#Local_Maximum">local
 * maximum algorithm</a>.
 * <p>
 * The local maximum method is a brute force searching algorithm which finds
 * the local maximum in a moving window. The window size is determined by a 
 * predefined a number of local points.
 * <p>
 * Initially, an <i>n</i>-point window is placed at the start point of data stream. 
 * The maximum in this window, as well as its index, is recorded. Then the 
 * window is moved one step further. If the new maximun is greater than 
 * the saved maximum, update both the maximum value and index value and then 
 * move forward. If the maximum moves out of the window, i.e. all points in 
 * the window are less than the maximum, a peak is found an the whole window 
 * configuration is reconstructed for the next peak.
 * <p>
 * For each input event, the processor outputs the height of the peak, or
 * the value 0 if this event is not a peak. Since an event needs to be out of
 * the window to determine that it is a peak, the emission of output events
 * is delayed with respect to the consumption of input events.
 * <p>
 * By default, the window is of width 5.
