-- Definition of the count

WHEN @P IS A processor:
  THE COUNT OF ( @P ) IS THE processor
  COMBINE (SELECT 1 FROM (@P)) WITH ADDITION.

-- Definition of the LTL temporal pattern we are looking for. We call the
-- resulting Boolean trace "MY PATTERN", but it could be anything.

WHEN @P IS A processor:
MY PATTERN IN ( @P ) IS THE processor
(SELECT (a) LESS THAN (2) FROM (@P)) AND (X (SELECT (a) GREATER THAN (1) FROM (@P))).

-- The property we evaluate. @T is a syntactical placeholder (it could be
-- any character string and uses "@" only by convention) that is
-- replaced by the benchmark by a stream reader connected to a file on disk.

THE COUNT OF ((MY PATTERN IN (THE TUPLES OF FILE "tuples1.csv")) WHERE (x) = (true)).
