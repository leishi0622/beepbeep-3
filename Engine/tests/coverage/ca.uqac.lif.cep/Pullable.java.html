/**
 * Queries events on one of a processor's outputs. For a processor with
 * an output arity &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;, there exists &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; distinct pullables,
 * namely one for each output trace. Every pullable works roughly like a
 * classical &lt;code&gt;Iterator&lt;/code&gt;: it is possible to check whether new
 * output events are available, and get one new output event.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * However,
 * contrarily to iterators, &lt;code&gt;Pullable&lt;/code&gt;s have two versions of
 * each method: a &lt;em&gt;soft&lt;/em&gt; and a &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; version.
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soft&lt;/strong&gt; methods make a single attempt at producing an
 *   output event. Since processors are connected in a chain, this generally
 *   means pulling events from the input in order to produce the output.
 *   However, if pulling the input produces no event, no output event can
 *   be produced. In such a case, {@link #hasNext()} will return a special
 *   value (&lt;code&gt;MAYBE&lt;/code&gt;), and {@link #pull()} will return
 *   &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;. Soft methods can be seen a doing &quot;one turn of the
 *   crank&quot; on the whole chain of processors --whether or not this outputs
 *   something.&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hard&lt;/strong&gt; methods are actually calls to soft methods until
 *   an output event is produced: the &quot;crank&quot; is turned as long as necessary
 *   to produce something. This means that one call to, e.g.
 *   {@link #pullHard()} may consume more than one event from a processor's
 *   input. Therefore, calls to {@link #hasNextHard()} never return
 *   &lt;code&gt;MAYBE&lt;/code&gt; (only &lt;code&gt;YES&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;NO&lt;/code&gt;), and
 *   {@link #pullHard()} returns &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; only if no event will
 *   ever be output in the future (this occurs, for example, when pulling
 *   events from a file, and the end of the file has been reached).&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;/ul&gt; 
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The lifecycle of a &lt;code&gt;Pullable&lt;/code&gt; object is as follows:
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;One obtains a reference to one of a processor's pullables. This
 *   can be done explicitly, e.g. by calling
 *   {@link Processor#getPullableOutput(int)}, or implicitly, for example
 *   through every call to {@link Connector#connect(Processor, Processor)}.&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;At various moments, one calls {@link #hasNext()} (or
 *   {@link #hasNextHard()} to check if events are available&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;One calls {@link #pull()} (or {@link #pullHard()} to produce the next
 *   available output event.&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * For the same processor, mixing calls to soft and hard methods is discouraged.
 * As a matter of fact, the Pullable's behaviour in such a situation is
 * left undefined.
